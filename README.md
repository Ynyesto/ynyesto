### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Antonio and I'm a Blockchain Developer looking for his first Web 3 job. I'm an Industrial Technologies Engineer (M. Sc.) with a master's degree in Automation and Robotics (so that would be two MScs ðŸ˜‹). I've been working on software since I finished college and started learning about Blockchain over two years ago now, and blockchain software development over a year ago. I've taken courses such as CodeCrypto Academy's [MÃ¡ster Ingeniero Blockchain](https://codecrypto.academy/master-ingeniero-blockchain/), Alchemy University's [Ethereum Developer Bootcamp](https://www.alchemy.com/university/courses/ethereum) or [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/)'s Solidity 101, Foundry 101 and Advanced Foundry courses.
