### Hi there! 👋

My name is Antonio and I'm a Blockchain Developer looking for his first Web 3 job. I'm an Industrial Technologies Engineer (M. Sc.) with a master's degree in Automation and Robotics (so that would be two MScs 😋). I've been working on software since I finished college and started learning about Blockchain over two years ago now, and blockchain software development over a year ago. I've taken courses such as CodeCrypto Academy's [Máster Ingeniero Blockchain](https://codecrypto.academy/master-ingeniero-blockchain/), Alchemy University's [Ethereum Developer Bootcamp](https://www.alchemy.com/university/courses/ethereum) or [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/)'s Solidity 101, Foundry 101 and Advanced Foundry. Right now my main occupation (besides my day job) is to keep creating a portfolio of projects that make my profile attractive for Web 3 companies. I've already participated in hackathons like [Constellation](https://chain.link/hackathon) by Chainlink and [Block & Change](https://hackathon.blockandchange.com/) and intend to keep working on personal/group projects as well as other courses.

Creating this readme presenting myself is a task long overdue and I will be posting and linking all the different projects I've been working on for the past year soon!
