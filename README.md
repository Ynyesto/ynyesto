# Antonio Rodr√≠guez-Ynyesto üõ†Ô∏è

**`Blockchain Developer/Researcher`** </br>
**`Co-founder and SC Dev at BitChill`**

I'm an Industrial Technologies Engineer (M. Sc.) with a master's degree in Automation and Robotics (so that would be two MScs üòã) by [Technical University of Madrid](https://www.upm.es/). I've been working on software since I finished college and started learning about Blockchain in early 2022, and blockchain software development in the summer of the same year. I believe this technology will completely revolutionize the world, and once I realized this I decided I wanted to be a part of that revolution. Being an engineer, what made most sense to me was to become a Web3 dev/researcher. That is why over in mid 2022 I embarked on a learning journey that will hopefully continue full-time in a Web3 company soon.

I've taken courses such as CryptoZombies, CodeCrypto Academy's [M√°ster Ingeniero Blockchain](https://codecrypto.academy/master-ingeniero-blockchain/), Alchemy University's [Ethereum Developer Bootcamp](https://www.alchemy.com/university/courses/ethereum) or [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/)'s Solidity 101, Foundry 101 and Advanced Foundry. Right now my main occupation (besides my full-time job) is to keep creating a portfolio of projects that make my profile attractive for Web 3 companies. I've already participated in hackathons like [Constellation](https://chain.link/hackathon) by Chainlink and [Dextools & Vottun](https://vottun.com/hackathon/). After the latter, which my team and I won, we applied for a [Rootstock grant](https://rootstock.io/grants/) and got it, which provides financial support for the development of our project, **[Bitchill](https://github.com/BitChillRSK/DCAdApp)**, in which I'm the **smart contract developer**.

Also, I am a [Chainlink Advocate](https://chain.link/community/advocates), since Chainlink is, to my mind, one of the key actors in the new paradigm that is coming.

## Dev portfolio
This is work in progress. Here I will link the different projects I have done as a developer since 2022.

### BitChill

BitChill is an automated, non-custodial and yield-bearing DCA dApp for periodic bitcoin purchases, deployed on Rootstock mainnet. This is the project I'm currently most dedicated to as a Smart Contract Developer and Co-Founder. After winning the Vottun & DexTools Hackathon, my team and I achieved a Rootstock grant to carry on with the development of the project. You can check out my work [here](https://github.com/BitChillRSK/DCAdApp/tree/smart-contracts/smart-contracts)!

### Courses

#### Chainlink CCIP bootcamp

In August of 2024 I completed the first ever Chainlink CCIP Bootcamp. You can find the repo containing all the work done during the course [here](https://github.com/ynyesto/CCIP-Bootcamp)!

#### Cyfrin Updraft courses
These are probably some of the most complete and highest standard courses out there when it comes to learning Solidity and Foundry. I took these before Cyfrin Updraft was even launched, in the form of Patrick Collin's [Solidity Foundry Course](https://youtu.be/umepbfKp5rI?si=DkXsESBdLM262FiD), which was then divided into these shorter courses to be uploaded to Patrick's new platform. Below you can find the code developed for some of the course's modules, since not all of them involved coding. Also, unlinke the other repos linked in this readme, no further explanations were added, but the links to the official repo were included instead, as well as the correspondence with Cyfrin Updraft's current courses.

#### Alchemy University Road to Web3 program

After completion of the Ethereum Developer Bootcamp, Alchemy proposes this 10-week [program](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/welcome-to-the-road-to-web3) to help new blockchain devs go from beginner to advanced. Below I will link the repo for each of them. 

<details closed>
  
1. [Develop an NFT Smart Contract (ERC721)](https://github.com/ynyesto/RoadToWeb3ERC721): This served to review concepts already known from other courses regarding the ERC721 standard, NFT metadata, IPFS and so on.
2. [Build a "Buy Me a Coffee" DeFi dApp](https://github.com/ynyesto/RoadToWeb3BuyMeACoffee): On this project, a simple smart contract to receive tips was developed and then interacted with from a Hardhat script, as well as from a front end.
3. [Make NFTs with On-chain Metadata with Hardhat and Javascript](https://github.com/ynyesto/RoadToWeb3NftsOnchainMetadata): Another Solidity, Javascript and Hardhat project, in which we created fully on-chain, dynamic NFTs, suitable for Web3 videogames.
4. [Create an NFT Gallery](https://github.com/ynyesto/RoadToWeb3NftGallery): On this project, we created an awesome NFT gallery with Next.js and Tailwind, to display NFTs fetching by wallet or collection.
5. [Create a Dynamic NFT with Chainlink](https://github.com/ynyesto/RoadToWeb3Chainlink): This was a project in which we leveraged three of Chainlink's services to create a dynamic NFT collection whose NFTs changed their metadata according to Bitcoin's price trend in a selected interval, choosing at random between three different images for each trend.
6. [Build a Staking dApp](https://github.com/ynyesto/RoadToWeb3StakingDapp): This was a great project to learn about Scaffold ETH and its different functionalities.
7. Build an NFT Marketplace from Scratch: Coming soon...

#### Alchemy University Ethereum Developer Bootcamp
The Ethereum Developer Bootcamp was very high quality course in which I learnt all about Ethereum from the very basics (accounting model, Merkle trees...) to Solidity development. The course was divided in eight modules, the last of which was a final project that had to be proposed by the student and only after validation by AU would the completion NFT be awarded. Take a look at the [repo](https://github.com/ynyesto/AUEthDevBootcamp) containing all the work done throughout the course, including the [final project](https://github.com/ynyesto/AUEthDevBootcamp/tree/main/Week%208%20-%20Final%20project), a payment system for automatic payments adjusted to the temperature outdoor workers have to endure, leveraging Chainlink's services, called SummerPay!

#### CodeCrypto Blockchain Engineer Master's Course
The CodeCrypto course was a 10 month program I signed up for after completing all of the CryptoZombies modules, when I decided I wanted to go all in into becoming a full-time blockchain dev. In it, I learnt all about web 3 development, starting from web 2 technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Docker or Kubernetes.

##### Web 2 Projects
The projects done after finishing all the lessons for the web 2 part of the course are featured below:
<details closed>

1. [Faucet](https://github.com/ynyesto/CodeCryptoFaucetProject): For the first project we made a faucet on a local Go-Ethereum network running on Docker. 
2. [SQL](https://github.com/ynyesto/CodeCryptoSqlProject/blob/main/README.md): On the second project we put into practice some of the back end development concepts learnt during the course.
3. [ETH e-commerce](https://github.com/ynyesto/CodeCryptoEthEcommerce): On the third project we leveraged both the local network created in the Faucet project and the database created on the SQL project. The latter was used as the product database of an e-commerce in which purchases would be made paying with ETH.
4. [Design](https://github.com/ynyesto/CodeCryptoDesignProject): This was a project consisting only of a React front end. The aim was to focus on the aesthetic side of web development. 
5. [Cryptography](https://github.com/ynyesto/CodeCryptoCryptography): On this project we learnt to different ways of encrypting and decrypting files with symmetric cryptography.
6. Block Explorer: Coming soon...
7. Ethereum network: Coming soon...
</details>

##### Web 3 Projects
Although CodeCrypto Academy promised that upon finishing the course students would have a project portfolio comprised of 7 EVM projects, this didn't turn out to be true. After much complaining about the low quality of the learning materials (well below the standards of the first half of the course) and the fact that no projects worth mentioning here were carried out, we got a certificate of completion stored in a HyperLedger network and no value for our money. After this terrible experience, my real learning started with all of the courses and projects listed above, as well as all the work showcased below.

### Hackathons

#### ETHGlobal Bangkok
After [Devcon 7 South East Asia](https://devcon.org/en/) I participated in the [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) [hackathon}(https://ethglobal.com/events/bangkok). My team and I created a tool for seamless migrations of ERC20 mainnet tokens to a multichain token on L2s, leveraging Scroll's L1SLOAD precompile to make the one time bridging possible, Vlayer's Time Travel feature to create an incentive system and Chainlink's CCIP and CCT standard to make the token multichain!

My role in this project was smart contract developer. More precisely, I was the sole contributor to the CCIP part, while my colleagues focused on the other technologies, as well as the front-end and the submission and the pitch material. I was also the pitch lead, both at ETHGlobal's and the sponsor's booths.

As you can see in our [project sumbission](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/migrator-ethbelgrade-7x4pc), **we won Blockscout's Pool Prize, Chainlink's Best use of Chainlink CCIP ($4,000) and Scroll`s Best Use Case of L1SLOAD (2nd place - $1,500)**, for a grand total of over $5,500!

You can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/GianfrancoBazzani/ETHGlobalBKK)!

#### Vottun & Dextools hackathon

The weekend of January 27th to 28th of 2024, I participated in the [hackathon](https://vottun.com/hackathon/) organized by Vottun and Dextools and sponsored by Rootstock. My team and I came up a dApp for automatized DCA Bitcoin purchases and **won the first prize**. Make sure to check out the [repo](https://github.com/ynyesto/VottunDextoolsHackathon)!

#### Constellation Chainlink hackathon

From the 8th of November to the 10th of December of 2023 I participated in the Constellation Chainlink Hackathon. This one was much longer and my team and I had time to develop a much more complex project. Check out the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CarlosAlegreUr/Constellation-ChainlinkHackathon-2023) and take a look at the [Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/prompt-fighters) as well!

#### Block & Change hackathon

In October 2023 I participated in a hackathon organized by Block & Change. My team and I worked tirelessly for almost 48 hours with very little sleep, but it payed off, we *won the prize for best social innovation*. Please find [here](https://github.com/ynyesto/BlockChangeHackathon) the repo with the code we developed that weekend.

### Recruitment challenges

Below are the repos corresponding to challenges I solved to prove my skills in selection processes.

#### Podproza Onchain Analysis
For this technical challenge I dived into the Bitcoin chain and did some analytics with Python. Check it out [here](https://github.com/ynyesto/PodprozaTechnicalChallenge)!

#### TruWeb3 ERC20 Cross Chain Mirror
This was a task I got from David, the CTO of [TruWeb3](https://truweb3.co/) who challenged me to make this [ERC20 Cross Chain Mirror](https://github.com/ynyesto/ERC20CrossChainMirror) contract following TDD methodology. I completed it successfully using Chainlink's CCIP!

#### FilmChain SC verification
This was a challenge to check my capability for a possible collaboration with the [FilmChain](https://filmchain.xyz/) project, which I completed with solvency. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/ynyesto/FilmChainSCVerification)'s README explaining how I did it!

### Freelance projects

#### FilmChain vesting
After successfully verifying the FILM token contract, I was hired by FilmChain to create a vesting contract for their early investors and team to have their tokens vested, with a one year cliff, with two different vesting schedules. Check out the [repo](https://github.com/ynyesto/FilmChainVesting)!

### Personal projects

#### Carbon _defootprint_ dApp
This was a personal project created for a POC presentation at my current company, in the railway sector. It consists of a smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet which simply stores the numbers representing the carbon footprint avoided by the user when they travel by train instead of flying. A React front end styled using Tailwind CSS was used to interact with the contarct. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/ynyesto/TrainCarbonDefootprint)!

#### Oasis Riddle
This is a repo demonstrating how to solve the Oasis Riddle, a fun challenge by Oasis Network (where you can earn 200 ROSE!), for which they hand out flyers with codes at Web 3 events. If you ever get one of those codes I've got your back, check out the [repo](https://github.com/ynyesto/OasisRiddle) and follow the steps to solve it in the blink of an eye!

## Researcher portfolio

Below you can see the different research projects I've carried out. I try to develop as wide a skillset as possible, not limiting myself to software development, but also engaging in blockchain related research.

### Quantitative research directions for staking providers

This was a piece of research I had to do to apply for a position at [Chorus One](https://chorus.one/). This I decided to post on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7171854584959623168/), since I like to stay active there as well. Hope you enjoy the read!

### Ethereum Protocol Fellowship wiki entry on PBS

In early 2024, I participated in the [Ethereum Protocol Fellowship Study Group](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/02/07/epf-study-group), which encourages students to contribute to the EPF wiki. Here's the [markdown file](https://github.com/ynyesto/ethereum-protocol-studies/blob/pbs/docs/wiki/research/PBS/pbs.md) and a [HackMD post](https://hackmd.io/@Ynyesto/BkwKsCtJ0) with the entry I wrote on Proposer-Builder Separation, in gratitude for which the guys at EPF granted me a stipend to go to an Ethereum convention!
