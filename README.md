**`Blockchain Developer`**

I'm an Industrial Technologies Engineer (M. Sc.) with a master's degree in Automation and Robotics (so that would be two MScs üòã). I've been working on software since I finished college and started learning about Blockchain over two years ago now, and blockchain software development over a year ago. I believe this technology will completely revolutionize the world, and once I realized this I decided I wanted to be a part of that revolution. Being an engineer, what made most sense to me was to become a Web3 dev. That is why over a year ago I embarked on a learning journey that will hopefully continue in a Web3 company soon.

I've taken courses such as CryptoZombies, CodeCrypto Academy's [M√°ster Ingeniero Blockchain](https://codecrypto.academy/master-ingeniero-blockchain/), Alchemy University's [Ethereum Developer Bootcamp](https://www.alchemy.com/university/courses/ethereum) or [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/)'s Solidity 101, Foundry 101 and Advanced Foundry. Right now my main occupation (besides my day job) is to keep creating a portfolio of projects that make my profile attractive for Web 3 companies. I've already participated in hackathons like [Constellation](https://chain.link/hackathon) by Chainlink and [Block & Change](https://hackathon.blockandchange.com/) and intend to keep working on personal/group projects as well as other courses. Also, I am a [Chainlink Advocate](https://chain.link/community/advocates), since Chainlink is, to my mind, one of the key actors in the new paradigm that is coming. 

Creating this readme presenting myself is a task long overdue and I will be posting and linking all the different projects I've been working on for the past year soon!

## Dev portfolio
This is work in progress. Here I will link the different projects I have done since 2022.

### CodeCrypto Blockchain Engineer Master's Course
The CodeCrypto course was a 10 month program I signed up for after completing all of the CryptoZombies modules. In it, I learnt all about web 3 development, starting from web 2 technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Docker or Kubernetes.

#### Web 2 Projects
The projects done after finishing all the lessons for the web 2 part of the course are featured below:

1. Design Project: This was a project consisting only of a React front end. The aim was to focus on the aesthetic side of web development. Take a look at the code [here](https://github.com/arynyestos/CodeCryptoDesignProject)!

### Hackathons

#### Block & Change hackathon

In October 2023 I participated in a hackathon organized by Block & Change. My team and I worked tirelessly for almost 48 hours with very little sleep, but it payed off, we *won the prize for best social innovation*. Please find [here](https://github.com/arynyestos/BlockChangeHackathon) the repo with the code we developed that weekend.

#### Constellation Chainlink hackathon
