**`Blockchain Developer`**

I'm an Industrial Technologies Engineer (M. Sc.) with a master's degree in Automation and Robotics (so that would be two MScs üòã). I've been working on software since I finished college and started learning about Blockchain over two years ago now, and blockchain software development over a year ago. I believe this technology will completely revolutionize the world, and once I realized this I decided I wanted to be a part of that revolution. Being an engineer, what made most sense to me was to become a Web3 dev. That is why over a year ago I embarked on a learning journey that will hopefully continue in a Web3 company soon.

I've taken courses such as CryptoZombies, CodeCrypto Academy's [M√°ster Ingeniero Blockchain](https://codecrypto.academy/master-ingeniero-blockchain/), Alchemy University's [Ethereum Developer Bootcamp](https://www.alchemy.com/university/courses/ethereum) or [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/)'s Solidity 101, Foundry 101 and Advanced Foundry. Right now my main occupation (besides my day job) is to keep creating a portfolio of projects that make my profile attractive for Web 3 companies. I've already participated in hackathons like [Constellation](https://chain.link/hackathon) by Chainlink and [Block & Change](https://hackathon.blockandchange.com/) and intend to keep working on personal/group projects as well as other courses. Also, I am a [Chainlink Advocate](https://chain.link/community/advocates), since Chainlink is, to my mind, one of the key actors in the new paradigm that is coming. 

Creating this readme presenting myself is a task long overdue and I will be posting and linking all the different projects I've been working on for the past year soon!

## Dev portfolio
This is work in progress. Here I will link the different projects I have done since 2022.

### CodeCrypto Blockchain Engineer Master's Course
The CodeCrypto course was a 10 month program I signed up for after completing all of the CryptoZombies modules. In it, I learnt all about web 3 development, starting from web 2 technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Docker or Kubernetes.

#### Web 2 Projects
The projects done after finishing all the lessons for the web 2 part of the course are featured below:

1. [Faucet](https://github.com/arynyestos/CodeCryptoFaucetProject): For the first project we made a faucet on a local Go-Ethereum network running on Docker. 
2. [SQL](https://github.com/arynyestos/CodeCryptoSqlProject/blob/main/README.md): On the second project we put into practice some of the back end development concepts learnt during the course.
3. [ETH e-commerce](https://github.com/arynyestos/CodeCryptoEthEcommerce): On the third project we leveraged both the local network created in the Faucet project and the database created on the SQL project. The latter was used as the product database of an e-commerce in which purchases would be made paying with ETH.
4. [Design](https://github.com/arynyestos/CodeCryptoDesignProject): This was a project consisting only of a React front end. The aim was to focus on the aesthetic side of web development. 
5. [Cryptography](https://github.com/arynyestos/CodeCryptoCryptography): On this project we learnt to different ways of encrypting and decrypting files with symmetric cryptography.
6. Block Explorer: Coming soon...
7. Ethereum network: Coming soon...

### Alchemy University Ethereum Developer Bootcamp
The Ethereum Developer Bootcamp was very high quality course in which I learnt all about Ethereum from the very basics (accounting model, Merkle trees...) to Solidity development. The course was divided in eight modules, the last of which was a final project that had to be proposed by the student and only after validation by AU would the completion NFT be awarded. The different projects developed during this course will be listed below:

1. Coming soon...
2. Coming soon...
3. Coming soon...

### Cyfrin Updraft courses
These are probably some of the most complete and highest standard courses out there when it comes to learning Solidity and Foundry. I took these before Cyfrin Updraft was even launched, in the form of Patrick Collin's [Solidity Foundry Course](https://youtu.be/umepbfKp5rI?si=DkXsESBdLM262FiD), which was then divided into these shorter courses to be uploaded to Patrick's new platform. Below I'll share some of the code developed during the course.

1. Coming soon...
2. Coming soon...
3. Coming soon...

Also, below you can see the 15 NFT badges I achieved by completing all the challenges of the course, one at the end of each lesson:

### Alchemy University Road to Web3 program

After completion of the Ethereum Developer Bootcamp, Alchemy proposes this 10-week [program](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/welcome-to-the-road-to-web3) to help new blockchain devs go from beginner to advanced. Below I will link the code developed for each of them. 

1. [Develop an NFT Smart Contract (ERC721)](https://github.com/arynyestos/RoadToWeb3ERC721): This served to review concepts already known from other courses regarding the ERC721 standard, NFT metadata, IPFS and so on.
2. [Build a "Buy Me a Coffee" DeFi dApp](https://github.com/arynyestos/RoadToWeb3BuyMeACoffee): On this project, a simple smart contract to receive tips was developed and then interacted with from a Hardhat script, as well as from a front end.
3. [Make NFTs with On-chain Metadata with Hardhat and Javascript](https://github.com/arynyestos/RoadToWeb3NftsOnchainMetadata): Another Solidity, Javascript and Hardhat project, in which we created fully on-chain, dynamic NFTs, suitable for Web3 videogames.
4. [Create an NFT Gallery](https://github.com/arynyestos/RoadToWeb3NftGallery): On this project, we created an awesome NFT gallery with Next.js and Tailwind, to display NFTs fetching by wallet or collection.
5. Create a Dynamic NFT: Coming soon...
6. Build a Staking dApp: Coming soon...
7. Build an NFT Marketplace from Scratch: Coming soon...
8. Build a Betting Game on Optimism: Coming soon...
9. Build a Token Swap Dapp with 0x API: Coming soon...
10. Create a Decentralized Twitter with Lens Protocol: Coming soon...

### Hackathons

#### Block & Change hackathon

In October 2023 I participated in a hackathon organized by Block & Change. My team and I worked tirelessly for almost 48 hours with very little sleep, but it payed off, we *won the prize for best social innovation*. Please find [here](https://github.com/arynyestos/BlockChangeHackathon) the repo with the code we developed that weekend.

#### Constellation Chainlink hackathon

From the 8th of November to the 10th of December of 2023 I participated in the Constellation Chainlink Hackathon. This one was much longer and my team and I had time to develop a much more complex project. Check out the project's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/CarlosAlegreUr/Constellation-ChainlinkHackathon-2023) and take a look at the [Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/prompt-fighters) as well!

### Personal projects

#### Carbon _defootprint_ app
This was a personal project created for a POC presentation at my current company, in the railway sector. It consists of a smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet which simply stores the numbers representing the carbon footprint avoided by the user when they travel by train instead of flying. A React front end styled using Tailwind CSS was used to interact with the contarct. Check out the repo [here](https://github.com/arynyestos/TrainCarbonFootprint)!
